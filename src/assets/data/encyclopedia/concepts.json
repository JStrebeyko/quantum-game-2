And light, any sort of light, light from the sun and light from a lightbulb, lights that you attach to your bike and laser light from your pointer, is an electromagnetic wave.</p><p>Electromagnetic waves are waves which are made of two components, the electric field (E) and the magnetic field (B) component. These two are orthogonal to each other (i.e. they are at 90 degrees to each other). An electromagnetic wave is much like a water wave, it moves up and down in a regular fashion. However, the special thing of electromagnetic waves is that they are <em>transverse waves</em>.</p><p>Transverse waves are special in the fact that the direction of propagation of the wave is orthogonal to the direction of the oscillation. Let’s come back to the sea wave, the waves are travelling towards the shore, however if we are in the water at a specific position, we are moving up and down and the wave rises and lowers, so the oscillation direction is vertical! This is also how electromagnetic waves work, and therefore also light.</p><p>So, to recap, light is an electromagnetic wave, this is a special type of wave, called transverse wave, because the direction of propagation of the wave is orthogonal to the direction of oscillation of the electric field.</p>"
